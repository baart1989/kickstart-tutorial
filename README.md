# Hardhat Boilerplate Typescirpt Starter

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

This project is forked from
[Hardhat Boilerplate Project](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate/edit/master/README.md)

## This is monorepo please use yarn to compile

```sh
git clone https://github.com/baart1989/hardhat-boilerplate-typescript
cd hardhat-boilerplate-typescript
yarn install
```

## Running with Hardhat's testing network:


```sh
npm run backend
// Then, on a new terminal
npm run deploy
npm run serve
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to `localhost 8545`.

## Running test's

```sh
npm test
```
